# branch-protecter

When the repository is created it automate the protection of the main branch. It notifies the owner with a  [@mention](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams)  in an issue within the repository that outlines the protections that were added.
